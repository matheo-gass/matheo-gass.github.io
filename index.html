<p>Hey, Rhubarb's here.<br><br>You probably noticed it, but SMBX World is now down, that's because there's another website called SMBX.World, so I don't want to create a confusion, and also because I'm making another website which will be called DKC2 World (I verified the name this time) and it's going to be much bigger and faster than SMBX World and will be Donkey Kong Country 2 themed.<br><br>I will see you on it when it will be hosted, when I'll get a job, I hope lol.<br><br>Click on the banner to check if it's online<br><br><a href="https://dkc2world.net"><img src="files/dkc2w.gif"></a></p>
